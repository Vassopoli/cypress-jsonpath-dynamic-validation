# Cypress JsonPath Dynamic Validation

Uses [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [jsonpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath) to make assertions dynamically based on text

This way, you can pass text as environment variables, as HTTP requests, APIs, or pretty much any integration that uses Strings, without depending on language's types or objects.

# Requirements
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/)

# Installing dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

# Running tests
```shell
npx cypress run
```
